Student Name: Nick Wrona

Project Name: Budget Grinch Stole Christmas

What I implemented: Implemented 10 Different Leaf node that dealt with moving agents based on checks with other agents. 
I implemented 2 Decorator nodes for repeating two times and until success.

What I liked about the project and framework: I really being given multiple different models.
It saved me time that I could focus on implementing nodes.

What I disliked about the project and framework: I felt very lost at first. Everything is neatly commented, but I wish some comments explained more.
I had to spend too much time trying to figure out the framework istead of making nodes.

Any difficulties I experienced while doing the project: There was a occasion were my tree was not showing in BehaviorTreeType.
It seemed to fix itself after restarting visual studios. Besides that, Decorators were difficult for me to understand.
